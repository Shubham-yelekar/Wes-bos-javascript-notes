- **JavaScript** is a lightweight , cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. 

- It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it.

- JavaScript can be used for **Client-side** developments as well as **Server-side** developments.

- JavaScript is both **imperative** and **declarative** type of language. 

- JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like [**Array**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-javascript/), [**Date**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-date-objects/), and [**Math**](obsidian://open?vault=Web%20Developer&file=%F0%9F%93%9A%20JavaScript%2F%F0%9F%97%83%EF%B8%8F%20JavaScript%20Wes%20Bos%2F2.1%20Function%20-%20Built-in), and a core set of language elements like [**operators**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-operators/), **control structures**, and [**statements**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-statements/). 

-   **Client-side:** It supplies objects to control a browser and its [Document Object Model (DOM).](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dom-document-object-model/) Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as **mouse clicks**, **form input**, and **page navigation**. Useful libraries for the client-side are [**AngularJS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-angularjs/), [**ReactJS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-js-introduction-working/), [**VueJS**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vue-js/) and so many others.

-   **Server-side:** It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is [**node.js**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-nodejs/).

-   **Imperative language –** In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call.

-   **Declarative programming –** In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to d

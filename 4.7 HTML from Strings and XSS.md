We are going to learn about creating HTML with strings, using **backtick** strings, which Wes showed us earlier.

This approach is Wes' favourite, but make sure to watch the video all the way through, because at the end Wes will show a potential security hole that comes up when using this method.

The main security flaw with this method is something called **XSS** which stands for **cross-site scripting**.

Create a new JavaScript file `creating-with-strings.js` and change the script src in the `index.html` file to point to our new file.

There is a property `innerHTML`, which is similar to `innerText`, which we can get off an element.

Select the element with the class of `item` and log it. ðŸ‘‡

```
const item = document.querySelector('.item');
console.log(item.innerHTML);
```

  ![browser console showing logged output of innerHTML](https://wesbos.com/static/1efe37d2259ba6d789f657b95517b342/82b28/264.png "browser console showing logged output of innerHTML")

You can see that `innerHTML` is a string of all the HTML that makes up what is inside of it.

That is a getter.

What if we try to use it as a setter, as shown below? ðŸ‘‡

```
item.innerHTML = `<h1>Hey How are you?</h1>`;
console.log(item.innerHTML);
```

  ![browser console showing logged output of innerHTML after its contents changed by setting on innerHTML](https://wesbos.com/static/7ad5db7f10c66c8e4dfe2ec436ec2893/8b69f/265.png "browser console showing logged output of innerHTML after its contents changed by setting on innerHTML")

The inside of the `div.item` has been updated with some HTML.

That works because if you set the `innerHTML` of an element with just a string, it will take the text and dump that HTML into the item. This can be used instead of te `document.createElement`, or `document.cloneElement` methods we used in the previous lesson.

If the string it is valid HTML, the browser will take the string, parse it and turn it into all the items.

_TIP: You may have noticed that in Wes code editor, he has the ability to type the first few letters of something and then expand it. He is using an extension called Emmet to get those expansions and using a command called Expand Abbreviation to expand them. It lets you write things like `div.item.item` which will expand out to `<div class="item iteme"></div>`._

One benefit of using backticks for single or double is that you can have a string that spans multiple lines, like so ðŸ‘‡

```
item.innerHTML = `
  <div>
    <h1>Hey How are you?</h1>;
  </div>
`;
```

It doesn't matter if you indent or put it all on one line, but having it on multiple lines does make it easier for you to read it when you code typically.

To recap: setting the `innerHTML` of your element is one way to dump a string of HTML in and have the browser create all the elements for us.

This method of inserting elements is useful not only because it has less steps than using `document.createElement` or similar methods, but it also gives you the ability to easily **interpolate** values.

Below is an example of that ðŸ‘‡

```
const src = `https://picsum.photos/200`;
const desc = "Cute pup";
const myHTML = `
  <div class="wrapper">
    <h2>Cute ${desc}</h2>
    <img src="${src}" alt="${desc}"/>
  </div>
`;
```

We are able to use the backtick syntax like `${variable}`, which allows us to pop variables right into the string template that we have.

This is similar to templating that exists in almost every programming language, although they all look a little different. The general idea is the same.

When we set the `innerHTML` of an element to equal `myHTML`, all the variables will have been populated. ðŸ‘‡

```
item.innerHTML = myHTML;
console.log(item.innerHTML);
```

  ![rendered html output matches that which was defined in javascript](https://wesbos.com/static/4a28cf4653cb4b7c610fb05ef0dfa97e/aa440/266.png "rendered html output matches that which was defined in javascript")

We could go a step further with the following code.

Take a look at the `width` variable and how we are interpolating the `width` variable in the `src` variable declaration.

```
const width = 500;
const src = `https://picsum.photos/${width}`;
const desc = "Cute pup";
const myHTML = `
  <div class="wrapper">
    <h2>Cute ${desc}</h2>
    <img src="${src}" alt="${desc}"/>
  </div>
`;
```

If you refresh the page, the image link will now return a much larger photo of 500px.

Besides security, one of the downsides to using this method to insert HTML is that the contents of the `myHTML` variable are not elements, they are just strings.

You can see that in two ways.

First, you can log the value of `myHTML` and you can also check and log it's type, like so ðŸ‘‡

```
console.log(typeof myHTML);
```

  ![browser console showing output when using typeof](https://wesbos.com/static/8b841b2087acae2079cf6b4724b84372/aa440/267.png "browser console showing output when using typeof")

```
myHTML.classList.add('special');
```

That means we cannot do things like add the code above ðŸ‘†.

If you try to do that, it will give you the following error ðŸ‘‡

> Cannot read property 'add' of undefined

  ![browser console showing error output - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined](https://wesbos.com/static/b4c6c2af20f1b3d8cf800bd3cb9bfa1d/84bf8/1448.png "browser console showing error output - Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'add' of undefined")

Similarly, if you try to do log `myHTML.classList`, you will see that it is also undefined.

Why?

Because it is only a string.

It only becomes an element once we dump it into the DOM by setting the `innerHTML`.

If you want to do things like add event listeners, add to the `classList`, dynamically change any attributes, like `title` or `alt` or `src`, it is not possible until you first dump it into the DOM.

Once you dump it into the DOM, you have to go ahead and pull it out.

Here is an example.

Let's say we wanted to add a class to the image within `myHTML`.

We would have to do that like so ðŸ‘‡

```
const itemImage = document.querySelector('.wrapper img');
itemImage.classList.add('round');
```

  ![rendered html output of img with attached class that was defined in javascript](https://wesbos.com/static/58ab31332d1843c1bbc0fb12570311ac/aa440/268.png "rendered html output of img with attached class that was defined in javascript")

## [](https://wesbos.com/javascript/01-the-basics/variables-and-statements#documentcreaterange-and-documentcreatefragment)document.createRange() and document.createFragment()

There are a few ways you can get around that and do the best of both worlds which is using `document.createRange()` and `document.createFragment()`.

Remove everything below the `myHTML` declaration within `creating-with-strings.js`.

Next, let's now turn the string into a DOM element.

```
const myFragment = document.createRange();
console.log(myFragment);
```

  ![browser console showing logged out fragment created using .createRange](https://wesbos.com/static/27136d21742790279f4533e8c1af03cc/a2b88/269.png "browser console showing logged out fragment created using .createRange")

This code creates something called a **range**.

A range is essentially a collection of elements or part of HTML that we can then work with. That is exactly what we want, we want to take the `myHTML` string and create a couple of fragments.

We can call another method directly on `document.createRange()` called `.createContextualFragment();` which takes in a string as a parameter, like so ðŸ‘‡

```
const myFragment = document.createRange().createContextualFragment(myHTML);
console.log(myFragment);
```

If you open the page in a browser and view the console, you will see that we have this thing called a **document fragment** (which is just a way of saying some HTML).

  ![browser console showing logged out fragment created using .createRange and .createContextualFragment](https://wesbos.com/static/f1c97d8ef2f303645e16ae2686b9b83a/ee455/270.png "browser console showing logged out fragment created using .createRange and .createContextualFragment")

Now, from within this fragment, we are able to access all of the elements that live inside of it.

What we have done is turned our HTML into true elements, that are still not on the page anywhere, but we have them as DOM elements and do do things like look for an image inside of a fragment using the following code ðŸ‘‡

```
myFragment.querySelector('img');
```

  ![browser console showing logged out img tag from querySelector on fragment created using  .createRange and .createContextualFragment](https://wesbos.com/static/264e0a3b86cc2e49701c905857d78061/aa440/271.png "browser console showing logged out img tag from querySelector on fragment created using  .createRange and .createContextualFragment")

Let's now try to append the fragment to the document.

Let's try `appendChild()`.

```
document.body.appendChild(myFragment);
```

That works! You could also do ðŸ‘‡

```
document.body.appendChild(myFragment);
```

You could also use `insertAdjacent()` which we learned about previously.

To recap:

When you want to create HTML from a string, you can dump it into the document using `innerHTML`, OR when you need to do things with the elements in JavaScript, you can turn it into DOM Nodes before it is dumped into the document with `createContextualFragment()`.

## [](https://wesbos.com/javascript/01-the-basics/variables-and-statements#security-and-sanitization)Security and Sanitization

We will have an entire video on security later in the course, but for now, we need to talk about the potential pitfalls of inserting HTML using strings.

One scenario you might run into is let's say you have an application where users have a profile which they can edit and customize such as changing their name or adding a description.

If a user were to put HTML where the description input is, what could happen is the HTML in turn could be rendered on to the page.

Let's demonstrate with an example.

  ![javascript code example showing a profile a user can customize](https://wesbos.com/static/39b0a8507587e01a360b930577ee4263/aa440/272.png "javascript code example showing a profile a user can customize")

Let's say we are taking this `desc` variable from somebody.

They could put add the following in their description ðŸ‘‡

```
const desc = `Cute pup <h1>LOVE THIS GUY</h1>`;
```

Add the code about where it says `Cute Pup` and refresh the HTML page.

You should now see that there is actually an `h1` tag that wasn't created from us.

  ![rendered html showing multiple header tags](https://wesbos.com/static/e8af3fc6bb013c04ad8a69ac0b1fc3d3/d6b80/274.png "rendered html showing multiple header tags")

Remember, in this example scenario, the description value would be coming from a database, from someone's editor when they typed it in. They just started to put some HTML.

They could also something like ðŸ‘‡

```
const desc = `Cute pup <h1>LOVE THIS GUY</h1><style>*{display:none;}</style>`;s
```

If you refresh the HTML page, you will see all the content is gone.

_Aside: This is what MySpace allowed you to do. You used to be able to put in your own style tags. So did Neopets._

In this scenario, we were just expecting the user to enter in text but they hijacked it and added whichever HTML they wanted to.

## [](https://wesbos.com/javascript/01-the-basics/variables-and-statements#xss-cross-site-scripting)XSS (Cross Site Scripting)

That is all fun and games until you get into **XSS** which is shortform for **cross-site scripting**.

XSS is where people try to insert script tags using a method like entering an HTML string in a text input such as your profile name.

The browser will then run the script tag, and you can do anything you want with that, like drain someone's bank account.

Imagine you were signing in to your online banking and your bank asked you to enter your name, and you included a script tag. You could do anything you want outside of that including deleting things, sending money, any type of malicious acting.

A very simple example of that is let's say you want to allow someone to include an image in the description of the picture from the example above.

Something like the following ðŸ‘‡

```
const desc = `Cute Pup <img src="https://picsum.photos/50"/>`;
```

That is okay, but let's say someone hijackts the `onload` event that is accessible via an attribute on the `img` element? That will run whatever JavaScript is supplied to it when the image loads.

For example ðŸ‘‡

```
const desc = `Cute Pup <img onload="alert('hacked');" src="https://picsum.photos/50"/>`;
```

If you refresh the HTML page, you will see an alert.

  ![webpage with active alert saying HACKED](https://wesbos.com/static/bad32e61b13a3b9db55adbd789cef041/062c8/275.png "webpage with active alert saying HACKED")

What happened there is you took data from the user and allowed them to run any JavaScript that they want on your website, which is a potential security hole.

Imagine that on Facebook you allowed someone to run any JavaScript, you could have your friends unfriend eveyrone, send malicious messages etc. Anytime you allow a third party to run JavaScript on your page, that is a huge security hole.

The only JavaScript that should be running on your page is JavaScript that you, the developer, authored, and from approved parties like Google Analytics.

To recap:

Cross Site scripting is when a third party injects a script tag through a security hole like this.

In the security video, we will go over how to scrub your HTML of any potential security vulnerabilities like this before you dump it.
